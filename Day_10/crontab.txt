Crontab, stands for cron table, which is a list of commands scheduled to run at regular time intervals on the system.

If we need to schedule any task on Linux, we should basically edit the crontab file. We can do that using the below command.

crontab -e              # edit the crontab file
crontab -l              # list current cron tasks
crontab -u username -e  # edit other users's crontab file


* * * * * <shell command>   # execute cron job every minute
0 1 * * * <shell command>   # execute cron job every day at 1 a.m.
* * 1 * * <shell command>   # execute every minute in January
* * * * 6 <shell command>   # execute every minute on every saturday
0 1/15 * jan,jun mon,fri <command> # execute at every 1 a.m. and 3
                                     p.m. every monday and friday on
                                     january and june




Finally letâ€™s create some crontab tasks. Create a cron task writes the system date information every day at 1 p.m. to the date.log file.
crontab -e
0 13 * * * date >> /home/ec2-user/date.log
Create a cron task updates and upgrades our server every Sunday at 3 a.m.
0 3 * * sun sudo yum update -y
List the cron tasks.
crontab -l
